    "Today, colorization is done by hand in Photoshop, a picture can take up to one month to colorize. It requires extensive research. A face alone needs up to 20 layers of pink, green and blue shades to get it just right. But something changed this year when Amir Avni used neural networks to [troll the subreddit](http://www.whatimade.today/our-frst-reddit-bot-coloring-b-2/) [/r/Colorization](https://www.reddit.com/r/Colorization/) - a community where people colorize historical black and white images manually using Photoshop. They were astonished with Amirâ€™s deep learning bot - what could take up to a month of manual labour could now be done in just a few seconds.\n",

A lot of has to do with how many epochs you train it and which training data you use. *I'd recommend starting with 20-100 images* and **saving at regular intervals**. Once you get a feel for it, you can increase the number of images. Also, use a lot of validation images to understand where it's good and where it struggles.\n",

    "- A different dataset (you can use **ds-big**)\n",
    "- Enable the network to grow in accuracy with more pictures\n",
    "- Build an amplifier within the RGB color space. Create a similar model to the coloring network, that takes a saturated colored image as input and the correct colored image as output.\n",
    "- Implement a weighted classification\n",
    "- Use a classification neural network as a loss function. Pictures that are classified as fake produce an error. It then decides how much each pixel contributed to the error.\n",
    "- *Apply it to video* (This is a killer AI product). Donâ€™t worry too much about the colorization, but make the switch between images consistent. You could also do something similar for larger images, by tiling smaller ones."
